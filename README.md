👋 Hi, I’m Aamir Virani (@avirani-everlaw)

👀 I’m interested in building cool things.

🌱 I’m currently learning about Everlaw through the onboarding.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to get up to speed here!

📫 How to reach me: email or phone; I'm trying to live offline a bit more so I'm not carrying a smartphone.

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I am from Houston, so I am a Rockets fan.  If you're a Warriors fan, it's okay.
